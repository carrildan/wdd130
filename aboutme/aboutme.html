    <h1><font color="red"> About Me</font></h1>
    <h2>My name is Daniel. </h2>
    <h3>nickname: dancarril</h3>
    <p>My degree is Applied Technology but I´m currently taking a certificate course called Computer Programming. I´m enjoying to learn code and hope it will make an important part of my professional life.</p>
    <p>I´m from Brazil but currently I´m living in Spain with my beautiful wife, Elisangela. We have 2 angels in our lives, Sophia(4) and Anthony(2). </p>
    <p>I believe that learning code and getting certificated will push my professional life. There are several vacancies on this area (at least here in Spain) and there are so many options inside this field. For now, I want to start my career as a front-end developer however, not in a far future, I want to learn and work with Big Data.</p>
    <p>I am so happy to be with you guys. Hope I can be helpful and get some help.<br> See you shortly.</p>
